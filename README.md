## How to Contribute
### Setting up your development environment
To set up the required programs to contribute code to the game, follow these instructions:
1. [Install Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe?_ga=2.44506595.613451577.1609220232-1621664689.1584733812)
2. After installing Unity Hub, install [Unity version 2020.2.1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
4. Follow the [instructions to setup Visual Studio Code for Unity](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity)
5. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
6. Login to GitHub Desktop with your GitHub credentials
7. In GitHub Desktop, go to File > Clone repository > URL and enter `https://github.com/ubco-video-game-development-club/rpg`

### Git Standards
Our team uses Feature Branches for our git flow. This means that each feature (typically described by a single Issue) should have its own branch that may be worked on by multiple collaborators. All features will be merged into the `dev` branch using Pull Requests, and each PR must be reviewed by at least 1 individual before it can be merged.

Naming conventions should follow Git standards: branches should be written in `kebab-case` and commit messages should be written in imperative form (i.e. "Update item assets" not "Updated item assets" or otherwise).

Our repository uses a `master` branch and a `dev` branch. The `master` branch should always contain stable code that represents a complete set of features. The `dev` branch contains stable code that may contain parts of in-progress features, and is used for testing different features together before they are merged to `master`.

### Uploading your code changes to the project
If you are unfamiliar with Git use, please talk to one of the team leaders (preferably through Discord) to help you get started. This is a basic overview of the process of submitting your code changes:
1. Ensure you are working on the branch pertaining to your current feature
2. After each set of changes, commit those changes to the branch
3. Once your feature is complete, create a new pull request for your feature and request a code review

## FAQ (Updated Dec 30th 2020)

**What is club-wide-rpg?**  
The RPG is a VGDC club project that is currently in early development. The premise is a duck-themed top-down roleplaying game which includes story-focused gameplay with a detailed character progression system. Check out the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/ubco-video-game-development-club/rpg/wiki) of the GitHub repository for more documentation, as well as the #rpg-faq channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ydXaAjQ).

**Who runs this project?**  
This project is run by several of the club executives: [Jaden Balogh](https://github.com/JadenBalogh), [Adam Collins](https://github.com/wubbadukky), [Megan Nguyen](https://github.com/lilmergo), and [Logan Parker](https://github.com/LoganParker). The repository, meetings, tasks and final decisions are all organized by this team. However, any club member is welcome to contribute (see below)!

**What parts of the game are currently being worked on?**  
The game is still in early implementation phases. This means programming core systems and tools to allow us to play and add content to the game. We are using the Unity game engine to accomplish these tasks. Alongside this, our designers and artists will be developing the early concept art and story work for the game.

**How can I contribute?**  
RPGs are one of the most design-heavy genres out there. If you're interested in the low-level implementation of core gameplay systems and tools, and you have some experience with Unity or are interested in working alongside an experienced member, please feel free to join our development team! If you're interested in fleshing out concept art and/or story development, we'd love to have your input also! See the How to Contribute section above for details.

We have project-specific meetings for this project on Wednesdays at 4:30pm Pacific time in Discord. These are free-flowing meetings that also serve as a designated work time for the project. Please message #rpg-discussion in Discord if you're interested in contributing or have any questions or comments!
