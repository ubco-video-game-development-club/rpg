## FAQ (Updated Oct 12th 2020)

**What is club-wide-rpg?**  
The RPG is a VGDC club project that is currently in early development. The premise is a duck-themed top-down roleplaying game which includes story-focused gameplay with a detailed character progression system. Check out the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/ubco-video-game-development-club/rpg/wiki) of the GitHub repository for more documentation, as well as the #rpg-faq channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ydXaAjQ).

**Who runs this project?**  
This project is run by several of the club executives: [Jaden Balogh](https://github.com/JadenBalogh), [Adam Collins](https://github.com/wubbadukky), [Megan Nguyen](https://github.com/lilmergo), and [Logan Parker](https://github.com/LoganParker). The repository, meetings, tasks and final decisions are all organized by this team. However, any club member is welcome to contribute (see below)!

**What parts of the game are currently being worked on?**  
The game is still in early implementation phases. This means programming core systems and tools to allow us to play and add content to the game. We are using the Unity game engine to accomplish these tasks. Alongside this, our designers and artists will be developing the early concept art and story work for the game.

**How can I contribute?**  
RPGs are one of the most design-heavy genres out there. If you're interested in the low-level implementation of core gameplay systems and tools, and you have some experience with Unity or are interested in working alongside an experienced member, please feel free to join our development team! If you're interested in fleshing out concept art and/or story development, we'd love to have your input also!

We have project-specific meetings for this project on Wednesdays at 4:30pm Pacific time in Discord. These are free-flowing meetings that also serve as a designated work time for the project. Please message #rpg-discussion in Discord if you're interested in contributing or have any questions or comments!
