## FAQ (Updated Oct 12th 2020)

**What is #club-wide-rpg?**  
The RPG is a VGDC club project that is currently in early development. The premise is a duck-themed top-down roleplaying game which includes story-focused gameplay with a detailed character progression system. Check out the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/ubco-video-game-development-club/rpg/wiki) of the GitHub repository in the for more documentation, as well as the #club-wide-rpg channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ydXaAjQ).

**Who runs this project?**  
This project is run by several of the club executives: [Jaden Balogh](https://github.com/JadenBalogh), [Adam Collins](https://github.com/wubbadukky), [Megan Nguyen](https://github.com/lilmergo), and [Logan Parker](https://github.com/LoganParker). The repository, meetings, tasks and final decisions are all organized by this team. However, any club member is welcome to contribute (see below)!

**What parts of the game are currently being worked on?**  
The game is still in early design phases. This means answering questions like "what combat system will we use?" and "what are the art style guidelines?" in broad terms, then writing documentation for these decisions. We are also writing out story and lore concepts to better flesh out the world we are creating.

**How can I contribute?**  
RPGs are one of the most design-heavy genres out there. If you're interested in high-level discussions, planning and documentation of features like the following, then we'd love to hear your input:
 - Combat and movement systems
 - Art and graphics specifications
 - World and map creation
 - Story and quest structure
 - Character progression systems
 - Many many more

We have project-specific meetings for this project on Wednesdays at 4:30pm Pacific time in Discord. These are free-flowing meetings that also serve as a designated work time for the project. Please message #club-wide-rpg in Discord if you're interested in contributing or have any questions or comments!
